YouSC, an Events@USC App
What is it?
YouSC centralizes events around USC to make your college experience truly about YOU! College can be quite isolating at times, and knowing about campus events can be difficult. By allowing users to add and view events at USC on a map, as well as interact through commenting and up/downvoting, YouSC helps students stay connected in real-time!
